# IETF116 “Environmental Impact” Side Meeting


## Abstract and Context:

Over the past decade, there has been an increasing awareness of the environmental impact introduced by the widespread adoption of Internet technologies. While the impact of Internet technologies has an overwhelmingly positive impact (providing alternatives to travel, enabling remote/hybrid work, providing communication support for crisis response, enabling technology-based endangered species conservation, etc.,) there are also negative components and, most importantly, a lot of room remains for us to understand and address these negatives going forward.

This potentially includes (1) understanding and reducing negative environmental impacts across the lifecycle of Internet systems, as well as (2) leveraging communication architectures and systems for understanding and reducing other environmental impacts.

Following the _IAB workshop on Environmental Impact of Internet Applications and Systems, 2022_, this side meeting provides a forum during IETF116 for a continuation of the discussions and actions. 


## Purpose and Goals:

The “Environmental Impacts” side meeting in IETF116 has the following goals:



1. Provide a concrete continuation to the conclusions and actions from the IAB workshop on Environmental Impact of Internet Applications and Systems, 2022.
2. Bring together parties interested in and working on the topic, and compile an overview of work already taking place in different pockets of the IETF.
3. Establish, prioritize, and coordinate actionable work items for the IETF to focus on. 
4. Discuss the potential need and mechanics for continued coordination across the IETF on this topic. Non-exhaustive list of potentials:
    1. BOF – (Non-)WG forming.
    2. Sustainability Directorate with AD Sponsor.
    3. IAB Program
    4. Simple mailing-list.
